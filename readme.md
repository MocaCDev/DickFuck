# DickFuck
<p style="font-size:18px">DickFuck is a dumb compiled language purely based on cuss words. It was though of whilst I was driving one day, and so I decided I would make it. It takes some features that C++ has and implies it in its own ways, such as virtual functions. However, C++ has OOP, DickFuck does not. DickFuck is, more-or-less, a bad-profanity C knock off with C++ features, excluding the overhead of a shit ton of add-on features.</p>

## Keywords
<code>dick</code> - This keyword tells the compiler that a variable declaration is taking place - I chose this because of the word declaring.. *cough* dicklaring, lol.</br>
<code>fuck</code> - This keyword tells the compiler that a function declaration is taking place - I chose this because of the word function.. *cough* fucktion, lol.</br>
<code>shit</code> - This keyword tells the compiler that a structure definition is ocurring - I chose this beause structures hold a bunch of shit for us developers, lol.</br>
<code>bitch</code> - This keyword tells the compiler that a enum definition is ocurring - I chose this because bitches enumerate through anything they can get, lol. </br>
<code>hoe</code> - This keyword implies that the function, and its code, will be able to be "redefined" in another source file. If this keyword is not found before <code>dick</code> then the function, and its body, is considered constant and cannot be redefined. Upon having a function with `hoe` before `dick`, when the function gets redefined it is only redefined for the given file of which it was redefined in. I chose this because hoes like to change depending on the environment and who they're with, lol. </br>
<code>prick</code> - This is the built-in print function. I chose this because, will, it was the closest cuss word to `print` as I could get, lol. </br>
<code>slit</code> - This is the return statement. I chose this because people who slit are wanting to give up, and returning from a function is giving up a value that existed in the function, lol. </br>
<code>suck</code> - This is a built-in function to get input from the terminal. I chose this because only when you suck do you get something from the other end, lmfao. </br>
<code>dad</code> - This is `NULL`, as it is known in C. I chose this because a lot of people don't have a dad, lmfao. </br>
<code>mom</code> - This will be the built in `calloc`, as it is known in C. It will allocate X amount of memory of Y size. I chose thise because normally people have a mom and who knows how fat she is, LMFAO. </br>
<code>drugs</code> - This is the import statement. I chose this because drugs get imported from other countries, and so when you import code from another file the same sort of concept applies, lol. </br>
